# Naluri Coding Challenge

## The Problem 
The Naluri space project is investigating how we could model the solar system. As a first step
we’d like to calculate the circumference of the sun.

## The Solution
1. Create an HTTP server that is capable of <br>
  a. Calculating Pi to increasing accuracy e.g. 3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.141, 3.1415… etc. <br>
  b. Everytime the server has calculated the next decimal precision, it should store
      the most accurate value <br>
  c. When the server is queried via an HTTP GET request, it will respond with the
      most accurate value that the server has calculated <br>

2. Create a webapp that displays <br>
  a. The servers’ current known value of Pi <br>
  b. The circumference of the sun <br>
  
## The Approach 

1. For this algorithm, the Nilakantha series was chosen over the Gregory-Leibniz series because it had a higher rate of convergence and the sum of the Nilakantha series was within 0.002 of the actual value of $\pi$ compared to 0.2 of the Gregory-Leibniz series.  
2. Nilakantha formula : $$\pi = 3 + 4 \cdot \displaystyle\sum_{n \geq 0} \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+3)^3-(2n+3)}$$
3. Some rules were followed to implement this algorithm and those are as follows: <br>
    i. The total iteration is set to 1000000, because the higher the number of iterations the higher the precision. <br>
    ii. Three variables are created which are _sum_, _n_, and _one_. <br>
    iii. _sum_ will be set to 3, _n_ will be set to 2, _one_ will be set to 1. <br>
    iv. During each iteration, _n_ will be increased by 2 and _one_ will be added by the multiplication of _one_ and -1. <br>
    v. The _sum_ will be returned at the end of the iteration.

## The usage 
1. This repository consists of two folders which are the naluri_frontend and naluri_backend folders. The naluri_frontend folder consists of the frontend service of the application meanwhile the naluri_backend folder consist of the backend service of the application. 
2. Go to each respective folders and install the required modules by entering the following command:
```
npm install
```
3. Enter the following command to install axios to the frontend: 
```
npm install axios
```
4. Enter the following command to install Material UI to the frontend:
```
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```
5. The frontend service is started using the following command: 
```
npm start
```
6. The backend service is started using the following command: 
```
node index.js
```
## Future Improvements
In the near future, better algorithms such as the Chudnovsky algorithm with a higher rate of convergence can be used to calculate the PI value.
